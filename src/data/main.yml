    - title: My Web API template
      link: https://github.com/attuo/MyWebAPITemplate
      description: This is my opinionated template for creating APIs for my needs. This project started as my place to store the patterns and other cool things that I have found useful, when creating Web APIs with ASP.NET. This also saves so much time when starting a new project, when you have some boilerplate already made. My focus is to keep constantly updating the template, always when I learn something new and useful.
